## Overview
This site is built with **React 18**, **Less**, and **React‑Bootstrap**.  
All source code is publicly available at:  
[https://github.com/kagami-arch-jp/ollama-ui](https://github.com/kagami-arch-jp/ollama-ui)

## Getting Started
1. **Obtain an API key**  
   - Visit the **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)** website and apply for an API key.  
   - The key is required to access the backend services.

2. **How the API key works**  
   - When you use this site, each request you send automatically includes your API key.  
   - The key is forwarded to the **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)** API gateway by our backend.  
   - **We do not store your API key** on our servers.

3. **Using the Site**  
   - Browse the UI built with React‑Bootstrap components.  
   - All interactions that require external data will be processed through the **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)** API using your key.

## Privacy & Security
- Your API key is never logged or persisted by this site.  
- If you prefer to have full control, you can clone the repository and deploy the project yourself (e.g., on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)). Detailed deployment instructions are available in the repository’s documentation.

## Further Documentation
For detailed setup, configuration, and advanced usage, please refer to the official documentation at the repository’s README or the project’s docs page.
